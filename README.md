# 2048-Lite

 **2048 written in native JS**

----------------------------------

The game is fully written in native JS, HTML and CSS. I have chosen to call it 'Lite' as it lacks animations and the all-time best score panel, both of which are present in the original game (you can check the the original here https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

I have made this game as an exercise, but also to learn more and practice on my front end and general programming skills and knowledge.

You can try out the game <a href="https://vladislav-ss.github.io/2048-Lite/">HERE (GitHub pages)</a>.

Thank you for checking this out.
